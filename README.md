# 🌸 BloomWell – AI-Powered Mental Health Screening & Support System

**BloomWell** is a mental wellness screening web application that uses artificial intelligence to help individuals identify signs of depression and anxiety, and then provides therapeutic support through a conversation-like interface. It blends clinical screening tools with machine learning and LLMs to offer a seamless, private, and supportive experience.

## 💡 What is BloomWell?

Mental health issues like depression and anxiety often go undetected or unspoken. BloomWell aims to **bridge that gap using AI**, providing users with an accessible and non-judgmental way to:

1. **Self-assess their mental health** using trusted questionnaires (PHQ-9 and GAD-7).
2. **Get instant predictions** of their depression and anxiety levels using a trained machine learning model.
3. **Engage in a therapeutic AI chat** that responds empathetically based on their scores, offering conversation and self-help strategies.

This system can be used by:
- Psychology students or researchers
- AI/ML learners
- People interested in digital mental health
- Educational institutions for demos

> **Disclaimer**: BloomWell is a prototype for academic purposes and is **not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or treatment**.

## 🤖 How the AI Works

BloomWell uses two layers of intelligence:

### 1. **Machine Learning Prediction**
- Uses **Random Forest** classifiers trained on a labeled dataset of questionnaire responses.
- Input: PHQ-9 (9 depression questions), GAD-7 (7 anxiety questions), and lifestyle factors like sleep and activity.
- Output: Mental health severity levels such as:
  - No Depression / Mild Anxiety
  - Moderate Depression / Severe Anxiety
- Predictions are based on pattern recognition learned from synthetic but structured data.

### 2. **Therapeutic LLM Chat**
- After prediction, the user enters a **chat interface** powered by an AI language model (LLaMA).
- The chatbot acts like a therapist: validating feelings, asking clarifying questions, and gently offering self-care advice based on the user’s profile.

## 🔗 Download Model Files

Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, the trained model files are hosted externally:

🔗 [Click here to download all model files (.pkl)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12FwrMCcBHvwvhW9qj4sVitkTFpLcegLY?usp=sharing)

This folder contains:
- `rf_anxiety_model.pkl`
- `rf_depression_model.pkl`
- `le_anxiety.pkl`
- `le_depression.pkl`

📂 After downloading, place **all 4 files** inside the local `models/` folder before running the app.
